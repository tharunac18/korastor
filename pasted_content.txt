This is the complete product blueprint for Kørastor. It is designed to be a premium, science-backed nicotine cessation tool that balances data-driven motivation with psychological support.
1. Brand Identity: "The Nordic Anchor"
 * Name: Kørastor (derived from "Kora" - to choose/select, and "Stor" - Great/Strong).
 * Design Language: Nordic Minimalist. High contrast, plenty of white space (representing clean air), and rounded, organic shapes.
 * Primary Interaction: The "Center Pulse." A single, multi-functional button that handles logging, cravings, and celebrations.
2. Onboarding: The Setup (User Input)
The onboarding isn't just a form; it's a "Contract with Yourself."
 * Habit Profile:
   * Type: Smoke, Vape, or Snus (or a combination).
   * Intensity: Units per day (e.g., 15 cigarettes, 1 pod, or 0.5 tins).
   * Cost: Price per unit in local currency.
   * Nicotine Strength: High, Medium, Low (used to calculate withdrawal timelines).
 * The Motivation (The "Why"):
   * The user selects a "North Star": Wealth (Money), Vitality (Health), or Legacy (Family).
 * The "Reward Vault":
   * The user inputs a specific item they want to buy with the saved money (e.g., "New Tech - $500").
3. Core Features & Architecture
A. The Dashboard (The "Vessel")
The main screen features a "Vessel" icon—a semi-transparent circle representing the user's body.
 * Visual State: If the user is on a streak, the Vessel is clear and glowing. If they "slip," it becomes cloudy.
 * Live Metrics: * Money Saved: A rolling ticker (e.g., $142.53).
   * Life Regained: Time added back to life expectancy (calculated based on clinical data).
   * The Streak: Total days/hours since last consumption.
B. The "Pulse" Button (Intervention)
Located at the bottom center, this button changes based on context:
 * Hold for 3s: "I am having a craving." (Triggers the Dampener).
 * Single Tap: Log a slip-up (with a "No Judgment" follow-up screen).
 * Double Tap: View today's health milestone.
C. Craving Dampeners: "The 90-Second Peak"
Science shows cravings peak at 90 seconds. Kørastor offers:
 * Tactile Breathing: The screen expands and contracts; the user must keep their thumb on the sensor, following the haptic vibrations.
 * The Micro-Task: A random "Cognitive Distractor" (e.g., "Find 3 blue things in your room" or a quick "Swipe-to-Match" game).
 * Voice of Reason: A 15-second audio clip from a former quitter or a health professional.
4. The Health Restoration Map
A dedicated tab visualizing internal healing through a "System Status" table:
| System | Time to Restoration | Progress Bar | Current Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Blood Oxygen | 8 Hours | 100% | RESTORATED |
| Taste/Smell | 48 Hours | 85% | Nerves Reconnecting |
| Lungs | 1 - 9 Months | 15% | Cilia Regeneration |
| Heart Risk | 1 Year | 2% | Decreasing Load |
5. Gamification: Milestones & "Køra-Points"
 * Milestones: Instead of just "10 days," users unlock Shields.
   * The Bronze Shield (3 Days): Nicotine is out of your system.
   * The Silver Shield (3 Weeks): The habit loop is broken.
 * Køra-Points: Earned for every craving resisted. These points can be used to "Freeze" a streak once a month if the user has a slip-up, preventing the "What's the point of trying" spiral.
6. Technical Flow (Input to Output)
The "Slip-Up" Protocol
If a user logs a unit, the app doesn't show a red "X." It asks:
 * "What was the trigger?" (Stress, Social, Alcohol, Boredom).
 * "How do you feel?" (Anxious, Guilty, Fine).
 * Actionable Advice: "You logged a Social slip. Next time you go out, try holding a cold water bottle to keep your hands busy."
 * Data Adjustment: The "Money Saved" ticker pauses for a set duration based on the cost of that unit.
7. The "Wishlist" Integration
A progress bar linked directly to the user's "Reward Vault" (from Onboarding).
 * Notification: "You just saved enough for 15% of your [New Tech]. You're $75 away from clicking 'Buy'."
 * Visual: The item's image slowly gains color/clarity as the user saves money.
Would you like me to write the "Day 1" notification sequence to show how Kørastor starts the journey for a new user?
